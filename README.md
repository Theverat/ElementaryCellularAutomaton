Elementary Cellular Automaton
===========================

>In mathematics and computability theory, an elementary cellular automaton is a one-dimensional cellular automaton where there are two possible states (labeled 0 and 1) and the rule to determine the state of a cell in the next generation depends only on the current state of the cell and  its two immediate neighbors. As such it is one of the simplest possible models of computation. Nevertheless, there is an elementary cellular  automaton (rule 110, defined below) which is capable of universal computation.

[Download Binary](https://github.com/Theverat/ElementaryCellularAutomaton/releases/tag/v1.0)

You will need Qt Creator 2.7.0 or cmake 2.8.8 or higher to compile the code.

Steps to compile with cmake on Linux:
Run the "compile.sh" script, then look into the "build" folder. The Binary is named "CellularAutomaton".
